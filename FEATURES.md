- **Status Bar Integration**: The status bar now shows the current theme name

### Available Themes:

- **Dracula** (`dracula`) - Popular dark theme with purple/pink accents
- **Solarized Light** (`solarized`) - Easy-on-eyes light theme

## üîê Early Access Authentication

A secure authentication system has been implemented to control access to SkriptPanda Studio.

### Features:
- **Secure Access Control**: Requires a specific early access code to use the application
- **Professional UI**: Clean, branded authentication interface
- **Persistent Authentication**: Users stay logged in until they explicitly log out
- **Input Validation**: Real-time validation with clear error messages
- **Password Toggle**: Option to show/hide the access code while typing

### Early Access Code:
```
Isntitcoolguys???
```
*(Case-sensitive, includes three question marks at the end)*

### How to Use:
1. **First Visit**: Enter the early access code on the authentication screen
2. **Access Granted**: You'll be redirected to the main application
3. **Persistent Login**: You won't need to re-enter the code on subsequent visits
4. **Logout**: Click the logout button (üö™) in the top-right header to sign out

### For Developers:
Testing utilities are available in the browser console:
```javascript
// Clear authentication (force logout)
window.authTest.clearAuth()

// Set authentication (force login)
window.authTest.setAuth()

// Check current authentication status
window.authTest.checkAuth()
```

## üìÅ Last File Persistence

The editor now automatically remembers and reopens the last files you were working on when you return to the application.

### Features:
- **Workspace-Specific Memory**: Each workspace remembers its own set of open files
- **Tab Restoration**: All previously open tabs are restored when you reload the app
- **Active File Memory**: The last active file is automatically selected
- **File Validation**: Ensures saved files still exist before attempting to restore them
- **Automatic Fallback**: Opens a default file if saved files are no longer available

### How it Works:
1. **Automatic Saving**: Every time you open/close files or switch between tabs, the state is saved
2. **Workspace Isolation**: Each workspace maintains its own separate file history
3. **Smart Restoration**: When you reload the app or switch workspaces, your last session is restored
4. **Validation**: The system checks that saved files still exist in the current workspace
5. **Graceful Fallback**: If saved files are missing, it opens a default file from the scripts folder

### Storage Keys:
- `skriptpanda.openTabs.{workspaceId}` - Array of open file tabs for each workspace
- `skriptpanda.activeFileId.{workspaceId}` - ID of the active file for each workspace

### For Developers:
Testing utilities are available in the browser console:
```javascript
// Show current last file data for all workspaces
window.lastFileTest.showLastFileData()

// Clear all last file data (force fresh start)
window.lastFileTest.clearLastFileData()

// Set test data for a specific workspace
window.lastFileTest.setTestLastFile("workspace-id", "file-id", "test-file.sk")
```

All features maintain backward compatibility and enhance the existing functionality without breaking any current workflows.
