- **Event Name**: The name of the event.
- **Patterns/Syntax**: The syntax used in Skript code.
- **Since Version**: The version where the event was introduced (if known).
- **Description**: Detailed explanation, including triggers, event values, cancellability, and examples.

## sk-reflect Events

sk-reflect does not add any new events. It enables low-level Java reflection for accessing Bukkit/Spigot APIs, allowing custom event handling or registration of Bukkit events not natively supported in Skript. Use it to reflect on existing events or create custom ones via Java calls.# Comprehensive Guide to Skript and Addon Events

**Important Instruction for AI Users:**
Always search before writing or planning Skripts, and always conduct your own research too. This ensures accuracy, up-to-date information, and avoids reliance on outdated or incomplete data.

This document provides a full, ultra-deep compilation of all events available in the base Skript plugin and the specified addons: SkBee, SkQuery, Skript GUI (skript-gui), skript-yaml, and sk-reflect. Events are organized by category and addon for clarity. Each event includes:

- **Event Name**: The name of the event.
- **Patterns/Syntax**: The syntax used in Skript code.
- **Since Version**: The version where the event was introduced (if known).
- **Description**: Detailed explanation, including triggers, event values, cancellability, and examples.

Base Skript events are categorized for readability. Information is based on the latest available knowledge as of August 2025.

## sk-reflect Events

sk-reflect does not add any new events. It enables low-level Java reflection for accessing Bukkit/Spigot APIs, allowing custom event handling or registration of Bukkit events not natively supported in Skript. Use it to reflect on existing events or create custom ones via Java calls.
